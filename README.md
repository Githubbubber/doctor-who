## Issues I fixed: 
- "Navigation #1" (issue #8) - Need class to inverse the navbar

- "Navigation #2" (issue #9) - Need the correct navbar header class

- "Navigation #3" (issue #10) - Add a navbar brand using the Doctor Who Logo in the image files. The image should be resized to fit properly.
The logo should be right justified and not pop out of the navbar
The logo should have the responsive image class and be centered vertically

- "Navigation #4" (issue #11) - Create a button that will make a hamburger icon when the page is resized. Include the correct navbar toggle collapse classes from Bootstrap - also include the correct classes for data-toggle, data-target and aria-expanded.

- "Navigation #5" (issue #12) - Navbar background color should be black
Navigation font should be Playfair Display, 17 px, background of black with font white. Links should be right justified with a search bar (the search box should say "search" but the button should say "Allons-y"

- "Overall Body" (issue #1) - Need to link to the following fonts from Google Fonts: Playfair Display: 400, 700, 900 and Josefin Sans.
